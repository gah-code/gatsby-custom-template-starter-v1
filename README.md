## Introduction

This project seeks to pay tribute to two beloved experiences: the iconic social media platform MySpace and the timeless simulation game Roller Coaster Tycoon. Both of these experiences involve the act of creation and sharing information with the world. The goal is to create a customizable theme that captures the essence of these two experiences, while also allowing users to express their creativity and nostalgia in new and exciting ways.

Additionally, this web application aims to focus on accessibility, particularly for those with dyslexia. As part of this goal, the theme will be designed to offer features that cater to the needs of these individuals, such as a dyslexia-friendly font and color scheme. This will enable users with dyslexia to participate in the creation and sharing of content on the platform, without facing the barriers that often accompany traditional web interfaces.

Overall, this project is an opportunity to combine two beloved experiences in a way that encourages creativity and self-expression, while also promoting inclusivity and accessibility. By providing a platform that is accessible to all, regardless of their abilities, we can create a more diverse and vibrant online community.
